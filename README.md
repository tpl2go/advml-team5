Our paper replication exercise for Advanced Machine Learning module.

We replicated the paper:
Gal, Y., Hron, J., & Kendall, A. (2017). Concrete dropout. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 3584-3593).

Original code for this paper is found at:
<https://github.com/yaringal/ConcreteDropout>

Our implemented experiments:
- Synthetic data: following the Yarin's ipython notebook
- MNIST data: in the [./mnist-experiments](./mnist-experiments) folder
- UCI datasets
- Concrete Dropout on recurrent neural networks
